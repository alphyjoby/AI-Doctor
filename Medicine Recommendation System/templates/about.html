          <strong>AI Doctor</strong> is an intelligent healthcare assistant powered by machine learning, created to simplify and enhance the way we understand and respond to our health concerns.
          Built with a robust backend of multiple ML algorithms and deployed using Flask, AI Doctor is capable of analyzing user-provided symptoms to predict the most probable disease with impressive speed and accuracy.
        </p>

        <p>
          But AI Doctor doesn’t stop at just the diagnosis. Once a condition is identified, the system goes further by offering:
        </p>

        <ul>
          <li><strong>A detailed description</strong> of the predicted disease for better awareness</li>
          <li><strong>Precautionary measures</strong> to prevent complications or worsening of the condition</li>
          <li><strong>Suggested medications</strong> (non-prescriptive, informative only) to understand common treatments</li>
          <li><strong>Workout tips</strong> tailored to the user's condition to promote physical well-being</li>
          <li><strong>Dietary recommendations</strong> that support recovery and long-term health</li>
        </ul>

        <p>
          AI Doctor aims to empower users with accessible, reliable, and personalized health information.
          It’s not a replacement for a real doctor, but it’s a powerful tool for preliminary self-assessment, especially when you're unsure where to begin.
        </p>

        <p>
          Whether you're experiencing minor discomfort or just curious about symptoms, AI Doctor offers a private, always available solution that encourages proactive health management.
          Designed with simplicity and user-friendliness in mind, it brings medical guidance to your screen anytime, anywhere.
